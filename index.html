        <h2>Junior in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a Junior at Bob Jones University studying computer science. 
                I work with the campus Custodial Department cleaning the Science Building.

           I previously worked at <a href="https://www.peoples.com/portal/site/peoples/">
                People's United Bank</a> as a Personal Banker for the past
                three years before coming back to BJU to finish a degree. I recently got
                engaged and am planning on getting married next summer while also continuing
                my education. I am also currently looking for a church in the Greenville area
                to start attending regularly.

             I enjoy <a href="https://www.geocaching.com/play">Geocaching</a>, 
                 reading, singing, and learning most anything from people
                 especially when they love what they are teaching.
